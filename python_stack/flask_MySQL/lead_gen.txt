1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT SUM(amount) as total_revenue, MONTHNAME(charged_datetime )
FROM billing
WHERE charged_datetime LIKE '2012-03%';

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT clients.client_id, SUM(billing.amount) as total_revenue
FROM billing
LEFT JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT clients.client_id, sites.domain_name
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT YEAR(sites.created_datetime) as created_year, MONTHNAME(sites.created_datetime) as created_month, sites.domain_name, COUNT(sites.domain_name) as site_created, clients.client_id
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 1                                   --  clients.client_id = 20 --
GROUP BY created_year, created_month;

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id), date_format(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') as date_generated
FROM sites
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'
GROUP BY sites.domain_name;

6.What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as full_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as total_leads
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY full_name;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as full_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as total_leads, MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) as months, YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) as created_year 
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime  LIKE '2011%' AND MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN 1 AND 6
GROUP BY clients.client_id, leads.registered_datetime;

What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as full_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as total_leads, sites.domain_name, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %D %Y') as generated_dates
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name, leads.registered_datetime;

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as full_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as total_leads, sites.domain_name
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as full_name, date_format(billing.charged_datetime, '%Y %M') as charged_date, SUM(amount)
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, charged_date
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as full_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name ORDER BY sites.domain_name SEPARATOR ' / ') as domain_names
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id;
